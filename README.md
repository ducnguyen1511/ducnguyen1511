📖 I'm an ambivert junior at the University of Science - VNUHCM, Faculty of Mathematics and Computer Science </br>
🧪 I make [random stuff](https://github.com/ngntrgduc/projects), [blog](https://ngntrgduc.github.io/) whenever I have no deadline </br>
🌱 I'm currently learning: Mathematics, Machine learning, and a bit of Computer science </br>
💫 Fun fact: I love listening to [music](https://soundcloud.com/ngntrgduc), sipping coffee while making 🐛 for my code </br>
